  	<h3>About Me</h3>
  	<p>I began my web development journey while working full time at a university. The Information Technology Department offered a workshop in creating an office website. Armed with very basic HTML knowledge, Notepad, and a password to my office's FTP site, I created a very basic yet informative website. Later the university switched to a Content Management System although I still preferred to edit many sections of the site in HTML.</p>
  	<p>In 2016 I contemplated furthering my career. I researched doctoral programs but found myself looking instead at Computer Science and Information System programs. I applied to the university and began taking courses toward a major in Computer Information Systems. After completing some classes I found the free Code Labs One program through Codefi. </p>
  	<p>Code Labs One included three sections. The first section was learning Ruby. The second section was learning Rails. The third section was a group project with a local business. My group was assigned to Red Letter Communications.</p>
  	<p>A few months after the class ended, Red Letter Communications announced a job opening for a Junior Web Developer. I worked as a web developer for 14 months creating websites for clients. Most websites were created for Wordpress using the frontend framework, Foundation. I also worked with a soon-to-be released web application for which the creation was out-sourced but that I would be responsible for updating which used Angular on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend. Unfortunately the company made a financial decision to out-source future web development so I had to seek other employment.</p>
  	<p>I currently work for Buchheit Inc. where I am responsible for editting and maintaining an internal web application that provides information to all divisions of the company. I meet daily with two other off-shore developers and coordinate our tasks with our supervisor. The web application was originally written using JSP and Javascript for the frontend and Java for the backend. We are working to convert the site to a PHP and Javascript frontend.</p>
